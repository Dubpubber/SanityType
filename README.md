# Project Purpose
The purpose of this game is to promote the importance of typing! SanityType is a game in which the player is challenged with every single word in the English language. As the player progresses, the levels get increasingly harder and the length of the words longer. How long can you keep your sanity?

My name is Tyler Crowe, I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I try to put aside time every week specifically for creating to further grow my skills. I’ve been programming for about 8 years now and have no plans on stopping now!
